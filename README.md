## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

It was a great learning process and a worthy challenge for me. Basically i learnt how to manipulate positioning, transform properties and using inline-flex.


```css
.card {
    display: inline-flex;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    border-radius: 8px 8px 8px 8px;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to improve more on positioning, more especially to maintain my pre-defined position on all screen size and to make it more responsive.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for insight on positioning.
